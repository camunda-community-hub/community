# Best practices for maintainers
Maintainers are often the first point of contact that new contributors have with an open source project, and significantly impact the way that the community is perceived. As such, community extension maintainers are a crucial part of the Camunda open source community, and in shaping the Camunda Community Hub. 

Having a clearly defined set of expectations that contributors can reference when interacting with your extension is the mark of an experienced maintainer. It lets people who might not be familiar with you, your circumstances, and your project know what to expect from you and when.

Here are a few key questions to consider as a maintainer of a community extension:

* How often you plan to review pull requests?
* Do new PRs need tests before acceptance? 
* Are you utilizing Issue Templates?
* Do you require issues be labelled in a certain way, or do you accept help from the community in regards to issue triage and management?
* What contributions will you accept? If you don't want help with a certain piece of code, state this clearly.
* How often you prefer people to follow up with you. For example, "You can expect a response from a maintainer on your open issue/PR within 7-10 days."
* Your weekly time commitment on the project. For example, "I spend about 5-10 hours per week on this project, but I welcome new contributions, help with issue triage, and writing or updating of documentation any time!"

Learning to say no, or even "Thanks for the pull request! We've added that to our backlog and will take a look at it in the next release cycle" is critical to the long term success of any community extension.
