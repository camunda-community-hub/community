### Contact the original project maintainer

* In your request, please be sure to detail as much as possible your plans for maintaining the extension moving forward.

### Let the Camunda DevRel team know
* If a maintainer confirms that they would like you to take over -- First of all, congratulations! Move on to the next step below.
* If no response is received within 30 days, continue onward.

### Fill out Abandoned Community Extension maintainer template

*   * Link to a discussion or screenshot of a discussion that shows you have made a good faith effort to contact the extensionâ€™s original developer.
* Communicate your plans for the extension in your proposal
  * If your plans are primarily code-based, please open a pull request with your proposed changes to the extension
  * What is your roadmap going to look like?
  * What features will you be prioritizing first?
  * Where would you like the extension to be in the future?
* Tag the [Camunda DevRel Team](https://github.com/orgs/camunda-community-hub/teams/devrel) on the open issue containing your maintainer request so that they can assign you the correct repository permissions in the Camunda Community Hub GitHub Organization.
