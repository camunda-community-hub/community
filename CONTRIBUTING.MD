## Issues and PRs

If you have suggestions for how this project could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions. If you have questions, too, we'd love to hear them.

We'd also love PRs. If you're thinking of a large PR, we advise opening up an issue first to talk about it. Look at the links in [Resources](#resources) if you're not sure how to open a PR.

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocking you that you would like an additional person to take a look at.

For more guidance around pull requests, visit our [Pull Request Process](/Users/miamoore/community/pull-request-process.md).

## Code contributions

While we have general guidelines, each community extension has its own preferences for accepting contributions. Check the repo for any specific guidance for contributing code.
We also have guidelines for [Maintainer and Reviewer expectations.](maintainer-reviewer-expectations.md)
