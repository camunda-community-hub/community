# Creating a new Camunda community extension
If you are interested in building a new Camunda Community Hub extension, please follow these instructions. 

* Set and confirm your commit email address. For more information on how to set your email address in GitHub, you can read the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address) which goes into much more detail on the subject. 
* Browse the hub to see if there is an extension that already matches your idea. Alternatively, you can post your extension idea in the Community Hub's [Discussions](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/discussions). 
* Sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/camunda-community-hub/community) and agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://camunda.com/events/code-conduct/). 
* Create a new repository. Title the repository with the name of your proposed extension.
* Open a New Community Extension proposal
     * To open a new Community Extension Proposal in the Camunda Community Hub, you can do so by viewing the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/issues/new/choose). Next, select `New Community Extension Proposal` from the available template options. After completing the template, open the issue and give it a meaningful title.
* Evaluate your extension's lifecycle status
     * Once your extension proposal issue has been opened, use your best judgement after reviewing our [community extension lifecycle documentation](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md) to identify where in the development process your extension is currently and add it to your extension's README along with a community extension lifecycle label. 

*Note that if your extension is new and/or untested, the label to apply to it should always be `proof-of-concept.`*
