## What is the Camunda Community Hub?

The Camunda Community Hub is a GitHub Organization for all of our community-contributed extensions. 

Extensions in the Camunda Community Hub organization are independently led and maintained projects by members of the broader Camunda open source community, some of whom happen to be Camunda employees, or are projects/tutorials that are created and maintained by the Camunda Developer Relations team!

We’ve put together some commonly asked questions and answers about the Camunda Community Hub, our approach to open source contributions and maintainership, and how we hope to empower our open source community in the future. 

## How to contribute

1. To join the community, [open an issue](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/issues) in this repository and ask to be invited to join the Camunda Community Hub if you are not already a member.

## Communication guidelines and expectations

As is the nature of open source software, maintainers and extension creators often wear many hats. These range from administrative, to QA, and much more. As extensions in the Camunda Community Hub are community led, it is crucial that users of extensions understand that maintainers are often working on community extensions in their free time. Please remember to be kind, and follow the [Camunda Community Code of Conduct](https://camunda.com/events/code-conduct/) when interacting with project maintainers.

Keep in mind that communication styles vary, and no two individuals communicate in the same way. Please do your best to remain helpful, and try to avoid making sweeping demands or generalizations whenever possible. It is expected that Maintainers will follow the Camunda Code of Conduct when interacting with community members, and the same holds true for community members interacting with extension maintainers.

> **Not ideal:** “This feature doesn’t work, please fix it!”

> **Preferred:** “This feature doesn’t work as expected when I [do XYZ], do you have any suggestions as to how I can fix it? Thank you so much!”

When closing a pull request as a community extension maintainer, please keep in mind the following examples of helpful communication:

> **Not ideal** “This is not following the current pull request conventions! I’m closing this issue.”

> **Preferred:** “I am closing this PR because this extension can’t support [use case]. In its current form, it would be improved by/better contributed to [XYZ]. Thank you so much for your work on this!”

## Troubleshooting and community support

If you’re encountering a problem, remember that the community is here to help! Please feel free to start a post on the [Camunda Platform forums](https://forum.camunda.io), or the Camunda Community Hub [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/discussions). 

If you have a question related to getting started contributing to the Camunda open source ecosystem, or need to reach out to the Camunda team, you can start a topic in our [Discussions](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/discussions), tag the [Camunda DevRel team](https://github.com/orgs/camunda-community-hub/teams/devrel) in an Issue or PR, or reach out via email: community@camunda.com. 

 We highly encourage you to post on the Camunda community forums about your extension, its wider impact for the open source community, and what made you decide to build a community extension. These are as follows:

### Meet the Camunda Developer Relations team

The [Camunda Developer Relations team](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/devrel-team) exists to serve the Camunda developer community, from internal employees to open source contributors, Enterprise customers, and the broader tech community. It is our goal to provide opportunities for developers to be more successful by making them aware of our solutions, enabling them to be successful through great experiences, and fostering a culture of collaboration.
