 # The extension lifecycle & badges
Camunda community extensions adhere to a project lifecycle that aims to balance the needs of the broader community with that of the Camunda ecosystem as a whole. This section will also detail the process for reporting abandoned/unmaintained extensions.

Community extensions will have the following badges applied to them in addition to the `Community Extension` label/badge, designating where they are in terms of current usability, project stability, and overall lifecycle status.

*One of these lifecycle badges is required for all repos in the Community Hub.*

### Proof-of-Concept <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Proof%20of%20Concept-blueviolet" alt="Violet purple Shields.io badge that reads Lifecycle: Proof of Concept">
* `Proof-of-Concept`/experimental extensions are just that, ideas that community members would like to explore further. They offer little support, nor do they promise any stability. 
* To add this badge to your repository, add the following code at the top of your extension's README file: ```![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Proof%20of%20Concept-blueviolet)](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md#proof-of-concept-)```

### Incubating <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Incubating-blue" alt="Blue Shields.io badge that reads Lifecycle: Incubating">
* Extensions with the `Incubating` label provide some degree of stability which is defined and adhered to by the project’s maintainer, community support, and are actively maintained and updated. Documentation gaps, roadblocks, bugs, and other issues are to be expected. 
* To add this badge to your repository, add the following code at the top of your extension's README file: ```![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Incubating-blue)](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md#incubating-)```

### Stable <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Stable-brightgreen" alt="Green Shields.io badge that reads Lifecycle: Stable">
* An extension with the `Stable` label has an active, thriving community surrounding it. It releases updates on a regular basis, has active maintainers and community participants, and may be actively used at an organizational level.
* See [Maintainer Expectations](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/blob/da53e7a16d4048b8f5910a573d16a355ab488a8b/maintainer-reviewer-expectations.md#L47) for more information on what it means to be a Stable extension. 
* To add this badge to your repository, add the following code at the top of your extension's README file: ```![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Stable-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md#stable-)```

### Deprecated <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Deprecated-yellowgreen" alt="Yellow Shields.io badge that reads Lifecycle: Deprecated">
* An extension with the `Deprecated` label is no longer being maintained. It may have been deprecated due to an official feature or other solution. Be sure to review the README and see if there is an alternative presented.
* While it may work on your machine just fine today, there is no guarantee that it will work in the future. **Use these extensions at your own risk.**

* To add this badge to your repository, add the following code at the top of your extension's README file: ```![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Deprecated-yellowgreen)](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md#deprecated-)```

### Unmaintained <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Unmaintained-lightgrey" alt="Light gray Shields.io badge that reads Lifecycle: Unmaintained">
* Extensions are considered unmaintained when the project’s owner is no longer updating the extension, or has not responded to open issues or pull requests within 30 days, or has notified a Camunda team member that they are no longer actively maintaining the extension.
* To add this badge to your repository, add the following code at the top of your extension's README file: ```![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Unmaintained-lightgrey)](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md#Unmaintained-)```

### Needs Maintainer  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Needs%20Maintainer%20-ff69b4" alt="Hot pink Shields.io badge that reads Lifecycle: Needs Maintainer">

If you are a maintainer that is no longer able to maintain your extension, or you would like an additional maintainer, you can add the `Needs  Maintainer` badge to your extension's README file to help notify others that the extension is in need of a maintainer.
  * To add this badge to your repository, add the following code at the top of your extension's README file: ```![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintainer%20Wanted-This%20extension%20is%20in%20search%20of%20a%20Maintainer-ff69b4)```
