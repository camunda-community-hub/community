# Code of Conduct

View the [Camunda Community Hub Code of Conduct](https://camunda.com/events/code-conduct/)

All Camunda Community Hub Members, maintainers, and contributors agree to adhere to the above Code of Conduct when interacting in the Community Hub.

#### A note on communication styles

When communicating with others on the Camunda Cloud Community forums or in Slack, it’s important to remember that not everyone communicates in the same way. 
Some individuals may be [neurodivergent](https://autisticuk.org/neurodiversity/), and thus may not communicate in a neurotypical manner. 
Please endeavor to understand [neurological differences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/neurodiversity) when communicating with other community members, so that this space is welcoming for everyone.

Others may learn or understand information differently from you. While someone may understand a diagram or Model at first glance, others may benefit from having a paragraph or two of information to read that explains what the diagram, Model, or example does. 
Remember that what may seem obvious to you may not be to someone else. 

We all come from different backgrounds and experiences. As such, keep in mind that not everyone has had access to the same learning tools, education, and experience that you may have. 
What may seem like an, “Easy,” or, “Quick,” solution for you may be difficult to understand, or challenging to implement for someone else. 

Above all, please be compassionate and empathetic when communicating with others.
