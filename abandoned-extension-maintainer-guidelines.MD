# Camunda Community Hub Guidelines for Becoming a Maintainer of an Abandoned Community Extension
## Being a Maintainer may mean that you're coding less and responding to issues, clarifying pull requests, fixing bugs, or triaging issues more often than you are working on code to build new features. Other times, you may be committing code and responding to issues as a team of one. 

However you maintain your extension, we at Camunda want to empower and enable our community hub extension Maintainers, and hopeful Maintainers--To do what they do best, see projects through to completion. 
Whatever that may look like. Whether it’s dusting off an abandoned extension, stepping up to help an overburdened Maintainer of a busy project, or even creating and maintaining something new. 

This documentation is intended for contributors who wish to apply to become a Maintainer of an Abandoned or Deprecated repository in the Camunda Community Hub, in addition to those repositories labelled as actively needing Maintainers.

Here are some of the first steps to take when considering becoming a Maintainer on a Camunda Community Hub extension that's been Abandoned, Deprecated, or has been labelled with 'Maintainer Wanted' [life cycle label](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md).

***Note that all extension Maintainers in the Camunda Community Hub are expected to follow our [Maintainer expectations](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community#maintainer-expectations).***

### Contact the original project Maintainer

* Make an effort to contact the Maintainer and ask them if they would be open to you taking over Maintainership of the project.
* In your request, please be sure to detail as much as possible your plans for maintaining the extension moving forward
* Link to a discussion or screenshot of a discussion that shows you have made a good faith effort to contact the extension’s original developer. Note that Maintainers have 30 days to respond.
** You can contact our Maintainers via GitHub, or on our community forums.
* If no response is received within 30 days, please notify the Camunda team at community@camunda.com 
** If a Maintainer confirms that they no longer wish to maintain the project in question, and that they would like you to take over--First of all, congratulations! Please notify Camunda Technical Community Builder [Rin Oliver](https://github.com/celanthe) on the open issue containing your Maintainer request so that they can assign you the correct repository permissions in the Camunda Community Hub GitHub Organization.

### Fill out your contact details and plans for the extension

* You can do so by filling out the [New Community Extension Maintainer Proposal](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=abandoned-extension-maintainer-proposal&template=abandoned-extension-maintainer-proposal.md&title=Abandoned+Extension+Maintainer+Proposal) issue template and raising a new PR in the repository you would like to become a Maintainer for.
* Communicate your plans for the extension in your proposal
** If your plans are primarily code-based, please open a pull request with your proposed changes to the extension
** What is your roadmap going to look like?
** What features will you be prioritizing first?
** Where would you like the extension to be in the future?

### Set clear communication expectations

Having a clearly defined set of expectations that contributors can reference when interacting with your extension is the mark of an experienced Maintainer. It lets people who might not be familiar with you, your circumstances, and your project know what to expect from you and when.

In particular, if you work on open source in your free time and do not get paid for it, and your extension is something they use and depend on in production, you should clearly state this up front. Often, people tend to assume that Maintainers get paid for their OSS work, when in fact much of it is volunteer work. 

Be honest and forthcoming about how much time you have to commit to working on the extension. It's important to note that this isn't the same as **how much time other people want you to spend working on the extension**, or even how much time you think it requires from you. 

Here are a few key questions to consider as a new Maintainer of a community extension:

* How often you plan to review pull requests
* Do new PRs need tests before acceptance? 
* Are you utilizing Issue Templates?
* Do you require issues be labelled in a certain way, or do you accept help from the community in regards to issue triage and management?
* What contributions will you accept? If you don't want help with a certain piece of code, state this clearly.
* How often you prefer people to follow up with you. For example, "You can expect a response from a Maintainer on your open issue/PR within 7-10 days."
* Your weekly time commitment on the project. For example, "I spend about 5-10 hours per week on this project, but I welcome new contributions, help with issue triage, and writing or updating of documentation any time!"

### Addressing feedback

Learning to say no, or even, "Thanks for the pull request! We've added that to our backlog and will take a look at it in the next release cycle," is critical to the long term success of any community extension.

All reviewers interacting with Maintainers in the Camunda Community Hub are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD) and our [reviewer expectations](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community#reviewer-expectations). 
If a reviewer or a community member is treating you in a way that violates our Code of Conduct or these expectations, please [report it](https://camunda.com/events/code-conduct/reporting-violations) as soon as possible.
