# Issue triage and labelling

Issue labels can be added directly to issues via GitHub. We also encourage community members to triage issues by adding or removing labels if they see an open pull request or issue without a label they feel it may need to improve its context, visibility, or move it forward in the issue triage process.

The following labels apply to community extension pull requests and issues:
