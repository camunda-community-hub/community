# Creating a new Camunda community extension
If you are interested in building a new Camunda Community Hub extension, follow these instructions:

1. Set and confirm your commit email address. For more information on how to set your email address in GitHub, read the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address) which goes into much more detail on the subject. 
2. Browse the hub to see if there is an extension that already matches your idea. Alternatively, you can post your extension idea in the Community Hub's [Discussions](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community/discussions). 
3. Sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/camunda-community-hub/community) and agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://camunda.com/events/code-conduct/). 
4. Create a new repository. Title the repository with the name of your proposed extension.
5. Open a New Community Extension proposal.
     * To open a new Community Extension Proposal in the Camunda Community Hub, you can do so by viewing the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/issues/new/choose). Next, select `New Community Extension Proposal` from the available template options. After completing the template, open the issue and give it a meaningful title.
6. Evaluate your extension's lifecycle status.
     * Once your extension proposal issue has been opened, use your best judgement after reviewing our [community extension lifecycle documentation](https://github.com/Camunda-Community-Hub/community/blob/main/extension-lifecycle.md) to identify where in the development process your extension is currently and add it to your extension's README along with a community extension lifecycle label. 

*Note that if your extension is new and/or untested, the label to apply to it should always be `proof-of-concept.`*
